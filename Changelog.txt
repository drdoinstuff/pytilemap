//todo
systemwide: sort out what needs to be a class attribute if it doesnt put it in 
__init__ and call it with super()
interface: listener- OnEvent based, windows and clickable/dragable
tiler: try moving tiler to a sprite - group draw method it might be faster
tiler: make tiler blit to a surface and then dirty blit to itwhen needed
tiler: when scrolling subsurf it and reblit it, then draw new tiles!

#how do I change all the pathfinding and everything else to the new map when it's loaded?

//02/01/2010
- removed alot of the window management script
+ unified the window focus system
+ objects are added to the event manager and render manager when they are started now
+ simple movement smoothing on NPCs
+ improved map reading alot! but made t alot harder to read the script :(
+ added a scan line effect as a test, screen surface should become just a normal surface
    and blit to the screen surface last thing.
- removed scanline effect <13% cpu vs >50% !!!!

bugs:
- window focus drops through windows if they ar layered
- movement smoothing gets out of sync with the map if you move it 
    when the avatar is moving, is reset on every tile, so not a huge issue
